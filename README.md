# 🌤️ **Hi, I’m Tim, a Frontend Engineer who builds things with feeling.**

I’m a Taiwan-raised, Bay Area-based **React Native + TypeScript** US engineer who loves creating products that feel warm, intuitive, and genuinely human.
I care about **craft**, **emotion-aware design**, and making technology feel like sunlight - clear, simple, and powerful.

Right now, I’m sharpening my full-stack skillset, building new projects, and documenting everything publicly as I grow.

## ✨ **A note from me**

I believe the best code is emotional:
functional, expressive, and quietly transformative.
I’m building toward that - one project, one repo, one day at a time.
